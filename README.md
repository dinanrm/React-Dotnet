# React-Dotnet
The application is equivalent to creating both an ASP.NET Core project to act as an API backend, and a standard CRA React project to act as a UI, but with the convenience of hosting both in a single app project that can be built and published as a single unit.
The ASP.NET Core app is intended to be used for data access, authorization, and other server-side concerns. The React app, residing in the ClientApp subdirectory, is intended to be used for all UI concerns.
